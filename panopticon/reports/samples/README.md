# Sample Reports

Place curated and sanitized report examples here for GitHub commits.

Rules:
- Keep only minimal fields required for demos or regression baselines.
- Remove internal hosts, absolute paths, chat/session content, and any possible personal data.
- Prefer deterministic values for timestamps/IDs when possible.
